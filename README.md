# Smart-Waste


### Problem 
Inefficient monitoring of trash cans leads to operational challenges, including frequent overflows and spillage. This inconsistency burdens cleaning staff who manage multiple trash bins, negatively impacting their operational efficiency.

### Vision
Our vision is to create a fully connected waste management analytics system. By outfitting trash and recycling bins with sensors and connectivity, we want to build a network that provides real-time bin fill status and more for intutionals includings goverments, schools, and enterprises.
